# Variables, Mutability, Constants & Type Annotations, Naming Conventions

---

## Variables

-   `let` is used to declare a variable.
-   `let` is immutable by default.
-   `let` is block scoped.
-   `let` is shadowable.
-   `let` is not hoisted.
-   You must explicitly declare mutability.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("x: {}", x);
    
    // x = 6; // ‚ùå Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    
    // Block scope example
    {
        let y = 10;
        println!("Inner y: {}", y);
    }
    // println!("Outer y: {}", y); // ‚ùå Error: y is not in scope here
}
```

### Variable Shadowing

-   You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable
-   This is called "shadowing" and allows you to reuse variable names
-   Each shadowing creates a new variable, it doesn't modify the original

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("Initial x: {}", x);
    
    let x = x + 1; // x is now 6
    println!("After first shadowing: {}", x);
    
    let x = x * 2; // x is now 12
    println!("After second shadowing: {}", x);
    
    // Shadowing in different scopes
    {
        let x = "inner value"; // This shadows the outer x only in this scope
        println!("Inner scope x: {}", x);
    }
    println!("Outer scope x is still: {}", x); // x is still 12 here
}
```

-   Shadowing lets you change the type of a variable while reusing the same name:

```rust
fn main() {
    let spaces = "   ";
    println!("spaces is a string with length: {}", spaces.len());
    
    let spaces = spaces.len(); // spaces is now a number (3)
    println!("spaces is now a number: {}", spaces);
    
    // This wouldn't work with mut:
    // let mut spaces = "   ";
    // spaces = spaces.len(); // ‚ùå Error: mismatched types
}
```

## Mutability

-   `mut` is used to make a variable mutable.
-   Mutable variables can have their value changed but not their type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("Initial x: {}", x);
    
    x = 6; // ‚úÖ Works because x is mutable
    println!("Modified x: {}", x);
    
    // x = "hello"; // ‚ùå Error: mismatched types, even with mut
}
```

### Use Cases for Mutability

-   When implementing algorithms that require in-place updates
-   When you need to improve performance by avoiding copying large data structures
-   When working with user input that changes over time
-   For counters and accumulators in loops

```rust
fn main() {
    // Counter example
    let mut counter = 0;
    while counter < 5 {
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);
        counter += 1;
    }
    
    // User input example
    let mut input = String::new();
    println!("Enter your name:");
    std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    println!("Hello, {}!", input.trim());
}
```

## Constants

-   `const` is used to declare a constant.
-   Constants are always immutable (no `mut` keyword allowed).
-   Constants must be annotated with their type.
-   Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope.
-   Constants can only be set to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any value computed at runtime.
-   By convention, constants are named using SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

```rust
// Global constants
const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
const MAX_USERS: u32 = 100_000;

fn main() {
    // Local constant
    const SECONDS_IN_HOUR: u32 = 60 * 60;
    
    println!("Pi: {}", PI);
    println!("Max users: {}", MAX_USERS);
    println!("Seconds in an hour: {}", SECONDS_IN_HOUR);
    
    // const RANDOM: u32 = rand::random(); // ‚ùå Error: calls in constants are limited
}
```

### Use Cases for Constants

-   When you need a value that is known at compile time and unlikely to change.
-   When you want to ensure that a value is not changed accidentally.
-   Constants are valid for the entire program runtime within their scope. They're useful for values that multiple parts of your program might need to know about.
-   For configuration values that should be used throughout your program
-   For mathematical constants
-   For defining limits, boundaries, or thresholds
-   For error codes or status codes

```rust
// Application configuration
const MAX_CONNECTIONS: u32 = 10_000;
const DATABASE_URL: &str = "postgres://localhost:5432/myapp";

// HTTP status codes
const HTTP_OK: u16 = 200;
const HTTP_NOT_FOUND: u16 = 404;
const HTTP_SERVER_ERROR: u16 = 500;

// Mathematical constants
const GOLDEN_RATIO: f64 = 1.618033988749895;
const EULER_NUMBER: f64 = 2.718281828459045;

fn main() {
    // Using constants for configuration
    println!("App will allow up to {} connections", MAX_CONNECTIONS);
    
    // Using constants for business logic
    let user_count = 8_500;
    if user_count < MAX_CONNECTIONS {
        println!("System load: {:.1}%", (user_count as f64 / MAX_CONNECTIONS as f64) * 100.0);
    }
}
```

## Type Annotations

-   You can explicitly specify a variable's type using a colon followed by the type.
-   Type annotations are often optional due to Rust's type inference, but they improve code clarity.
-   Type annotations are required in certain situations where the compiler cannot infer the type.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic type annotations
    let age: u32 = 30;
    let pi: f64 = 3.14159;
    let is_active: bool = true;
    let name: &str = "Alice";
    
    // Type annotations with complex types
    let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let coordinates: (f64, f64) = (41.40338, 2.17403);
    
    // When type inference needs help
    let parsed_number: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
    
    // Empty collections need type annotations
    let empty_vector: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let empty_hash_map: std::collections::HashMap<String, i32> = std::collections::HashMap::new();
}
```

## Naming Conventions

Rust has several standard naming conventions:

-   Variables and function names use `snake_case` (lowercase with underscores)
-   Constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (uppercase with underscores)
-   Types, traits, and enums use `PascalCase` (each word capitalized with no separators)
-   Modules use `snake_case`
-   Macros often use `snake_case!` with an exclamation mark

```rust
fn main() {
    // Variable naming (snake_case)
    let user_name = "Alice";
    let phone_number = "555-1234";
    
    // Constants (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
    const MAX_CONNECTIONS: u32 = 100;
    
    // Function naming (snake_case)
    fn calculate_total(price: f64, tax_rate: f64) -> f64 {
        price * (1.0 + tax_rate)
    }
    
    // Using types (PascalCase)
    struct UserProfile {
        name: String,
        age: u32,
    }
    
    enum ConnectionState {
        Connected,
        Disconnected,
        Connecting,
    }
    
    // Using a macro (snake_case!)
    println!("Hello, {}!", user_name);
}
```

### Naming Best Practices

-   Choose descriptive names that clearly convey purpose
-   Prefer longer, clearer names over short, cryptic ones
-   Use domain-specific terminology when appropriate
-   Be consistent with the standard library's naming patterns
-   For boolean variables, use prefixes like `is_`, `has_`, or `should_`
-   For functions that return boolean values, use verbs like `is_empty()` or `has_value()`

# Differences between Variables and Constants

| Feature | Variable | Constant |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Declaration | `let` or `let mut` | `const` |
| Naming convention | snake_case | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE |
| Mutability | Immutable by default, can be made mutable with `mut` | Always immutable |
| Type annotation | Optional (inferred) | Required |
| Shadowing | Can be shadowed | Cannot be shadowed |
| Value assignment | Can be assigned values computed at runtime | Can only be assigned constant expressions |
| Scope | Scoped to the block where they're declared | Available for the entire program runtime within their scope |
| Compile-time evaluation | Not required | Required |

## Best Practices

-   Use immutable variables by default for safer code
-   Only use `mut` when you need to change a variable's value
-   Use constants for values that are used throughout your program and won't change
-   Use shadowing to transform a value while keeping the same name
-   Use descriptive names for variables and constants
-   Add type annotations when they improve code clarity, especially for function signatures
-   Use constants instead of "magic numbers" in your code
-   Consider using `const` for values that are conceptually constants, even if they're only used once
