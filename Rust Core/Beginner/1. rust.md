# Rust

## Introduction

-   Rust is a systems programming language
-   Rust is a low-level language that is designed to be safe and fast.

## Features

-   **Performance** ‚ö°Ô∏è (close to C/C++)
    -   Rust is compiled to machine code, which allows it to achieve performance comparable to C and C++.
-   **Memory safety** üß† (without garbage collector)

    -   Rust prevents data races and null pointer dereferences through its ownership system.

-   **Concurrency** üßµ (fearless multithreading)

    -   Rust's design allows for safe concurrent programming, enabling developers to write multi-threaded applications without fear of data corruption.

-   **Type safety** üîí (no nulls, no type casting)
    -   Rust enforces type safety at compile time, preventing type errors and null pointer dereferences.

## How is Rust Different from Python?

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type System**       | Dynamic typing (runtime errors)                                       | Static typing + compile-time checks                                    |
| **Performance**       | Interpreted (slow)                                                    | Compiled (very fast)                                                   |
| **Memory Management** | Garbage collected (automatic)                                         | Manual via ownership + borrow checker(no garbage collector)            |
| **Concurrency**       | GIL limits real threads, Threading and multiprocessing, but less safe | No GIL, real threads, and memory-safe, Safe concurrency with ownership |
| **Type Safety**       | Dynamic typing (runtime errors)                                       | Static typing + compile-time checks                                    |
| **Use Cases**         | Scripting, web, ML, automation                                        | Systems, WebAssembly, game engines, CLI tools                          |

## What Happens Under the Hood in Rust?

Rust is **low-level and explicit**, which means:

-   **No garbage collector**: Rust ensures memory is released when it's no longer used ‚Äî thanks to _ownership system_.
-   **No runtime overhead**: No background thread or heap management unless you code it.
-   **Compile-time checks**: Borrow checker ensures safe memory access at **compile time**, not runtime.
-   **Zero-cost abstractions**: You can write high-level code, but it compiles down to machine code efficiently like C++.

-   **Ownership System**: Rust uses an ownership model to manage memory. Each value has a single owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. This eliminates the need for a garbage collector.
-   **Borrowing**: Rust allows references to values without transferring ownership, enabling safe access to data.

-   **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Rust provides high-level features without sacrificing performance, as abstractions are resolved at compile time.

So it's doing a lot of thinking **at compile time**, not at runtime.

## How Memory is Managed in Rust?

Rust uses a **borrow checker** to ensure that memory is managed correctly.

-   **Ownership**: Each value in Rust has a single owner.
-   **Borrowing**: References to values can be borrowed without transferring ownership.
-   **Lifetimes**: References must be valid for the duration of their use.
-   **No Garbage Collector**: Rust ensures memory is released when it's no longer used ‚Äî thanks to _ownership system_.
