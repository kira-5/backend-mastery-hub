# Ownership, References & Borrowing

---

## Ownership

### Ownership Rules

-   Each value in Rust has a variable that is its "owner".
-   A value can only have one owner at a time.
-   When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (memory is freed).

### Moving

-   When you assign a value to another variable, the ownership moves to the new variable. The original variable can no longer be used.

**Declaration:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s owns the String
    let t = s;                     // ownership moves to t, s is now invalid

    // println!("{}", s); // ‚ùå ErrorThis will cause a compile-time error
}
```

### Cloning

-   You can clone a value to create a new owner.
-   If you want to keep using the original variable, you can create a clone of the value.

**Declaration:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s owns the String
    let t = s.clone();             // t is a new owner, s is still valid

    println!("{}", s); // ‚úÖ Works
    println!("{}", t); // ‚úÖ Works
}
```

### Functions and Ownership

-   When you pass a value to a function, ownership moves to the function.
-   If the value is not moved, it can be accessed after the function call.

**Declaration:**

```rust
fn take_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("Got string: {}", s);
}

fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello");
    take_ownership(my_string); // Ownership moves
    // println!("{}", my_string); // ‚ùå Error: moved
}
```

## References (&T)

-   References allow borrowing a value without taking ownership.
-   Instead of transferring ownership, you can borrow a value using references.
-   Use `&` to create a reference.
-   Borrowed data must not be modified unless the reference is mutable (&mut).

**Declaration:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s owns the string

    let r1 = &s; // r1 borrows s
    let r2 = &s; // r2 borrows s

    println!("{}", r1); // ‚úÖ Works
    println!("{}", r2); // ‚úÖ Works
}
```

### Mutable References (&mut T)

-   Mutable references allow modifying the value they point to.
-   Use `&mut` to create a mutable reference.
-   Mutable references must be unique.
-   Only one mutable reference is allowed at a time.

**Declaration:**

```rust
 fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
        r1.push_str(" world");
        println!("{}", r1);
    } // r1 goes out of scope here

    let r2 = &mut s; // now valid!
    println!("{}", r2);
}
```

## Borrowing

### Borrowing Rules (Important!)

-   You can have either:
    -   One mutable reference or
    -   Multiple immutable references
-   References must always be valid
-   Mutable references have priority:
    -   If you have a mutable reference, you cannot have any immutable references.
    -   If you have multiple immutable references, you cannot have a mutable reference.

‚ùå **Example of violating the rule:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    let r3 = &mut s; // ‚ùå Cannot borrow as mutable because `r1` and `r2` are still active

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}
```

‚úÖ **Fix: Use after the immutable borrows are done**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    let r3 = &mut s; // ‚úÖ Valid
}
```

### Slices (Related to Borrowing)

-   You can borrow parts of a collection using slices.
-   Slices are immutable by default, like &str.

**Declaration:**

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    &s[0..5]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    println!("{}", word); // hello
}
```

## üìö Rust Ownership, References & Borrowing Summary

### Summary Pointers

**üîê Ownership**

-   Every value in Rust has **one owner**.
-   Ownership is **moved** when assigned or passed to a function.
-   When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **automatically dropped** (freed).

**üîÑ Move vs Clone**

-   **Move**: Transfers ownership (original becomes invalid).
-   **Clone**: Creates a deep copy (both variables can be used).

**üßæ Functions and Ownership**

-   Passing a value to a function **transfers ownership** unless it's a reference.
-   Use references (`&T`) to **borrow without transferring ownership**.

**ÔøΩ References (`&T`)**

-   Allow read-only **borrowing**.
-   Multiple immutable references are **allowed** at the same time.

**üõ†Ô∏è Mutable References (`&mut T`)**

-   Allow modifying the value.
-   **Only one mutable reference** is allowed at a time.
-   Cannot mix with immutable references.

**üö¶ Borrowing Rules**

-   You can have:
    -   ‚úÖ One mutable reference _or_
    -   ‚úÖ Multiple immutable references
    -   ‚ùå Not both at the same time

**‚úÇÔ∏è Slices**

-   A **slice** borrows a part of a collection (like strings or arrays).
-   Example: `&s[0..5]` is a slice of the first 5 characters.

| **Move**                         | Ownership transfers to new variable or function.        | New variable can use the value         | Old variable becomes invalid                |
| **Clone**                        | Deep copy, both old and new can be used.                | `let t = s.clone();`                   | -                                           |
| **Function Ownership**           | Passing value to function moves ownership.              | Pass by reference (`&T`) to avoid move | Using after move                            |
| **Immutable Reference** (`&T`)   | Allows read-only access.                                | Multiple at the same time              | Using mutable ref at the same time          |
| **Mutable Reference** (`&mut T`) | Allows modifying value.                                 | One mutable reference only             | With any immutable refs                     |
| **Borrowing Rule**               | Cannot mix mutable and immutable refs at the same time. | Either `&mut T` _or_ multiple `&T`     | Mixing `&mut T` and `&T`                    |
| **Slices**                       | Borrow part of a collection (like `&s[0..5]`)           | Immutable by default                   | Mutating while slice exists (unless `&mut`) |
