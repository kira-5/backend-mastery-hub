## üìù Strings

### Features of a String

- Denoted as `String`.
- Created using `.to_string()`, `String::from("text")`, or `.into()`.
- String are flexible i.e. they can be modified after creation.
- Strings in Rust are always UTF-8 encoded.
- Can be converted to &str using `.as_str()` or `&s[..]`.
- Mutable:
  - `String` is mutable if declared with `mut`.
- Memory Allocation:
  - String are heap-allocated, data is stored on the heap.
  - the pointer, length, and capacity metadata are on the stack.
- Ownership:
  - When a String is created, it owns the memory allocated on the heap.
  - When a String goes out of scope, its memory is automatically freed.
  - When a String is passed to a function, it is moved (not copied) to the function.
  - When a String is returned from a function, it is moved (not copied) to the caller.
- Performance:
  - Strings are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy.
  - Use `&str` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a string slice.

## üì¶ Array

### Features of an Array

- Array are fixed size collection of same type elements.
- Denoted by `[T; N]` where `T` is the type of the elements and `N` is the number of elements.
- Array are contiguous/ordered i.e. they are stored in sequential memory blocks.
- Array are fixed size i.e. once initialized cannot be resized.
- Array are homogenous i.e. they contain only one type of data.
- Memory for an Array is allocated in the stack because their size is fixed.
- Array don't have header i.e Arrays are plain sequences in memory without extra metadata like heap-allocated types.
- To identify array elements we use a unique integer known as a subscript i.e. index.
- Values in the array element can be updated or modified but cannot be deleted.
- Ownership:
  - Array are stack-allocated.
  - Array elements are copied when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
  - Array ownership is transferred when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
- Performance:
  - Arrays are stack-allocated, which means they can be fast to allocate and copy.
  - Use `&[T]` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a slice of an array.

## üìö Vector

### Features of a Vector

- Vector are dynamic size collection of same type elements.
- Denoted by `Vec<T>` where `T` is the type of the elements.
- Vector are contiguous/ordered i.e. they are stored in sequential memory blocks.
- Vector are flexible i.e. they can be resized.
- Vector are homogenous i.e. they contain only one type of data.
- Memory for a Vector is allocated in the heap because their size is dynamic.
- It‚Äôs not always exactly 2^n, but it grows exponentially, usually doubling.
- Ownership:
  - Vector are heap-allocated.
  - Vector elements are copied when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
  - Vector ownership is transferred when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
- Performance:
  - Vectors are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy.
  - Use `&[T]` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a slice of an array.

## üîó Tuples

### Features of a Tuple

- Tuple are collection of elements of different types.
- Denoted by `(T1, T2, T3, ...)` where `T1, T2, T3, ...` are the types of the elements.
- Tuples have a fixed layout, but since elements can have different types and alignments, they may not behave like a simple array in memory.
- Tuple are fixed size i.e. once initialized cannot be resized.
- Tuple are heterogeneous i.e. they contain different types of data.
- Memory Allocation:
  - Tuple are stored in the stack if all their elements are themselves stack-allocated (like integers, fixed-size arrays, etc.).
  - The tuple itself is on the stack, but its elements may contain pointers to heap data (like String, Vec).
  - The tuple is just a container. It lives on the stack, and holds pointers to the heap if any of its fields do.
- In tuples there is no inbuilt method to add elements into a tuple.
- We can use the index to get the value of a tuple, and we can not iterate over a tuple using for loop.
- Tuples don't support direct iteration or searching. Use pattern matching to destructure values.
- Ownership:
  - Tuple elements are copied when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
  - Tuple ownership is transferred when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
- Performance:
  - Tuples are stack-allocated, which means they can be fast to allocate and copy.
  - Use `(T1, T2, T3, ...)` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a tuple of elements.

```rust
    fn main() {
        let stack_tuple = (42, false); // Fully stack-allocated
        let heap_tuple = (vec![1, 2, 3], String::from("hi")); // Tuple on stack, data inside Vec and String on heap
    }
```

## üóùÔ∏è HashMaps

### Features of a HashMap

- HashMap are collection of key-value pairs.
- Denoted by `HashMap<K, V>` where `K` is the type of the key and `V` is the type of the value.
- Import from `std::collections::HashMap`.
- HashMap are not contiguous/ordered i.e. they are not stored in sequential memory blocks.
- HashMap are flexible i.e. they can be resized.
- Each key and each value is of a single, uniform type ‚Äî though key and value types can differ.
- Memory for a HashMap is allocated in the heap.
  - The HashMap structure itself (the metadata: pointer to the table, capacity, etc.) is stored on the stack.
  - The actual key-value pairs are stored on the heap.
- Keys are unique no duplicates allowed in the key but the value can be duplicated.
- We can check for key in the HashMap by using the `contains_key` method. but cannot check for value.
- Ownership:
  - HashMap elements are copied when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
  - HashMap ownership is transferred when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
- Performance:
  - HashMaps are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy.
  - Use `&HashMap<K, V>` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a reference to a HashMap.

```rust
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;

        let mut map = HashMap::new();
        map.insert("apple", 3);  // heap: "apple" => 3
    
    }
    // map live on the stack (just small structs).
    // Their contents (key-value or key-only) are on the heap.
```

## üéØ HashSets

### Features of a HashSet

- HashSet are collection of unique values.
- Denoted by `HashSet<T>` where `T` is the type of the value.
- Import from `std::collections::HashSet`.
- HashSet are not contiguous/ordered i.e. they are not stored in sequential memory blocks.
- HashSet are flexible i.e. they can be resized.
- HashSet are homogenous i.e. they contain only one type of data.
- Memory for a HashSet is allocated in the heap.
  - Like HashMap, the set‚Äôs internal data lives on the heap.
  - Only the reference/pointer to this structure is on the stack.
- Ownership:
  - HashSet elements are copied when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
  - HashSet ownership is transferred when passed to functions or assigned to other variables.
- Performance:
  - HashSets are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy.
  - Use `&HashSet<T>` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a reference to a HashSet.

```rust
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashSet;

        let mut set = HashSet::new();
        set.insert("apple");  // heap: "apple" stored as key
    }
    // set live on the stack (just small structs).
    // Their contents (key-only) are on the heap.
```

  - Heap-allocated if any field is heap-based (e.g., String, Vec<T>).
- Immutability by Default:
  - Fields are immutable unless declared mut.
  - Use `mut` keyword to make fields mutable.
- Ownership and Lifetimes: can add lifetimes to struct definitions for borrowing.
- Struct Update Syntax: Create new structs from existing ones using .. syntax.
- Pattern Matching: Structs can be destructured in let bindings or match expressions.

## üé≤ Enums

### Features of an Enum

- Enums are custom data types that let you define a type by enumerating its possible variants.
- Denoted by `enum Name { variant1, variant2, ... }`.
- Variants with Data: Each variant can hold different and even multiple data types.
- Memory Allocation:
  - Stack-allocated if all variants are stack types (e.g., integers, fixed arrays).
  - Heap-allocated if any variant contains heap-based types (e.g., String, Vec<T>).
- Used with match: Enums are heavily used with pattern matching for control flow.
