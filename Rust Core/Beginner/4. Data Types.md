## 🔑 String Types

### 📝 Overview

- **Unicode:** All Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded (can represent any Unicode character).
- **Not Null-Terminated:** Unlike C/C++, Rust strings are not null-terminated and can contain \0 bytes.
- **Two Main Forms:**
  - `&str` (string Literal): Immutable, borrowed view of a string.
  - `String` (string Object): Growable, heap-allocated UTF-8 string.

### 📍 String Literal (`&str`)

#### ✨ Features of a String Literal

- Denoted as `&str`.
- Primitive data type.
- Immutable (cannot modify the content).
- Stored in the binary (read-only memory) if it's a string literal ("hello"), or on the stack if it's a borrowed slice of a String.
- Lightweight (just a pointer + length) and doesn't own the data (it borrows it).
- It is a reference to a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.
- Value known at compile time (if it's a literal like "hello").
- String slice:
  - A reference to a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
  - Does not own the memory it points to; it borrows it from the original string.
- Also called as `string slice` or `string reference`.
- Cannot directly index (string[0]) because UTF-8 characters may span multiple bytes.
  - UTF-8 characters can be 1 to 4 bytes long.
  - Rust prevents O(1) indexing to avoid returning invalid byte sequences.

#### 💻 Example Usage of String Literal

```rust
  let string_literal = "🦀Rust";
  
  // ✅ Correct ways to access characters/bytes:
  
    // 1️⃣ Get nth character (returns `Option<char>`)
    let third_char = string_literal.chars().nth(2);  
    println!("Third character: {}", third_char.unwrap()); // Some('u')

    // 2️⃣ Get nth byte (returns `Option<u8>`)
    let first_byte = string_literal.bytes().nth(0);
    println!("First byte: {}", first_byte.unwrap()); // Some(240) (first byte of '🦀')

    // 3️⃣ Get substring (panics if invalid UTF-8)
    let substr = &string_literal[0..4];  // "🦀" (valid 4-byte slice)
    // let invalid = &string_literal[0..1];  // ❌ PANIC (splits emoji)

    // 4️⃣ Iterate over chars/bytes
    for c in string_literal.chars() { println!("{c}"); }  // Prints: 🦀, R, u, s, t
    for b in string_literal.bytes() { println!("{b}"); }  // Prints: 240, 159, 146, 144

  // ❌ This would NOT compile:
  // let invalid = string_literal[0];  // Error: cannot index `str`
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip**:
>
> - Use `.chars().nth(n).unwrap()` to access characters.
> - Use `.bytes().nth(n).unwrap()` to access bytes.
> - Use `[start..end]` to access a single character (safe for ASCII).
> - Use `.to_string()` to convert a string literal to a string object.
> - `.chars().nth(n)` is O(n) (must scan from start).
> - `.bytes().nth(n)` is O(1).
> - For frequent random access, consider storing chars in a `Vec<char>`.

#### 🎯 When to Use String Literal

- For read-only string data (e.g., literals, function args)
- When you don't need ownership (borrowing is cheaper)

### 🧵 String Object (`String`)

#### ✨ Features of a String

- Denoted as `String`.
- Created using `.to_string()`, `String::from("text")`, or `.into()`.
- Not null-terminated
- A string is encoded as a UTF-8 sequence
- String are growable and mutable i.e. they can be modified after creation.
- Encode string values that are given at the run time.
- Can be converted to &str using `.as_str()` or `&s[..]`.
- Mutable when declared with `mut`.
- Owns its data (freed when dropped).
- Data on heap; pointer/length/capacity metadata on stack.
  - Strings are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy.→ This is overstated.
  - Allocation is fast (Rust’s allocator is optimized).
  - Use clone() sparingly (prefer borrowing with &str).

#### 👑 Ownership Rules

- When a String is created, it owns the memory allocated on the heap
- When a String goes out of scope, its memory is automatically freed
- When a String is passed to a function, it is moved (not copied) to the function
- When a String is returned from a function, it is moved (not copied) to the caller

#### ⚡ Performance Considerations

- Strings are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy
- Use `&str` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a string slice
- For ASCII-heavy work, consider Vec<u8> (but UTF-8 is usually fine).
- Avoid unnecessary `clone()`/`format!()` in hot loops.
  - `format!` is fine for one-off strings; avoid it in tight loops.

```rust
  // ❌ Less efficient
  let s = format!("{} {}", part1, part2);  // Allocates new String

  // ✅ Better for joining many strings
  let mut s = String::new();
  s.push_str(part1);
  s.push_str(part2);
```

#### 💻 Example Usage of String Object

```rust
  // From a string literal (compile-time known)
  let s1 = String::from("Hello");
  // From runtime data (e.g., user input)
  let s2 = some_user_input.to_string();
```

> - Use `&str` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a string slice.

#### 🎯 When to Use String Object

- When you need mutable or owned string data.
- For building/modifying strings at runtime.

### 🎯 Best Practices

#### 📌 Function Parameters

- **Prefer `&str` for function parameters** (unless you need ownership):

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) { 
    println!("Hello, {name}!"); 
}

// ✅ Both of these work:
greet("Alice");                    // String literal
greet(&String::from("Bob"));       // String reference
```

#### 📌 String Usage

- **Use `String` when:**
  - You need to modify the string
  - You need to own the string
  - You're building strings dynamically

#### 📌 ASCII Optimization

- **For ASCII-only text:**
  - Consider `Vec<u8>` for byte-level control
  - Consider `&[u8]` for byte slices
  - Most Rust code uses UTF-8 strings even for ASCII—only optimize if profiling shows a bottleneck."
  
#### Prefers

- Prefer iteration (.chars(), .bytes()) over indexing/slicing.
- Use slicing only when you know the byte offsets are valid.
- For String specifically:
  - Convert to &str via .as_str() or &* before slicing.
  - Modify in-place with .push_str() or .replace_range().

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** When in doubt, start with `&str` and upgrade to `String` only if you need ownership or mutability.

#### Iteration

| Method | Time Complexity | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| `.chars()` | O(1) per iteration | General purpose |
| `.chars().nth(i)` | O(n) per access | Occasional access |
| `Vec<char>` | O(1) after creation | Frequent random access |
| `.as_bytes()` | O(1) | ASCII-only text |
