## 🔑 String Types

- Strings in Rust come in two main forms: &str (string slice) and String (owned, growable string).

### 📍 &str

#### Features of a String Slice

- Denoted as `&str`.
- It is an immutable view into a string—borrowed data.
- Stored in the binary or stack, depending on usage.
- Lightweight and doesn't own the data it references.
- &str is just a reference; it does not manage or free memory.
- String slice:
  - A reference to a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
  - Does not own the memory it points to; it borrows it from the original string.

### 🧵 String

#### Features of a String

- Denoted as `String`.
- Created using `.to_string()`, `String::from("text")`, or `.into()`.
- String are flexible i.e. they can be modified after creation.
- Strings in Rust are always UTF-8 encoded.
- Can be converted to &str using `.as_str()` or `&s[..]`.
- Mutable:
  - `String` is mutable if declared with `mut`.
- Memory Allocation:
  - String are heap-allocated, data is stored on the heap.
  - the pointer, length, and capacity metadata are on the stack.
- Ownership:
  - When a String is created, it owns the memory allocated on the heap.
  - When a String goes out of scope, its memory is automatically freed.
  - When a String is passed to a function, it is moved (not copied) to the function.
  - When a String is returned from a function, it is moved (not copied) to the caller.
- Performance:
  - Strings are heap-allocated, which means they can be slow to allocate and copy.
  - Use `&str` for performance-critical operations where you need to work with a string slice.
